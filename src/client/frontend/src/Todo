Input validation

Need to display validation errors such as trying to create a date in the past
Runs need a current capacity
Can't sign up for run if full
People need to be able to see who signed up for runs
Back end should only return runs that are in the future.
User Profile and Clubs need to specify if user is an admin.
Spell check
Update modals to camel case
Clean up routing
Declining a run isn't working
Data and Time should specify formatting in Add/Edit (yyyy-mm-dd)
